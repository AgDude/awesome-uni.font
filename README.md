Repacked Font Awesome font. Mostly, for use in fontello. If you plan to use it
in your project - see license details on [original page](http://fortawesome.github.com/Font-Awesome/).

Note, that ALL requests about artwork should be sent into original project.


Info
----

Difference from original:

- mapped to fit unicode 6.1 standard (where possible)
- realigned from baseline to middle line of small letters
- rehinted with `ttfautohint`
- grouped glyphs on demo page, for convenience
  (and synced order with other iconic fonts)
- changed css glyphs names, to be more semantic
